Hi! I'm Jeth, a professional data analyst with experience on more than 7 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, SQL, Implementation, Consulting, and Microsoft Applications. Now, I'm eager to leverage my skills in the supply chain realm to drive growth and improve efficiency. 

Currently, I am looking to start my career as a data analyst while also utilizing my 2 years of experience with implementation consulting. My last 2 roles have helped to develop my communication, analytical, time-management, and problem solving skills. 
In late 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen 6-month Data Analyst program. The curriculum covered Microsoft Excel, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects. 

Some facts about me: 
- I graduated from the University of Houston with a bachelor's degree in supply chain management
- I enjoy going to the gym, playing guitar, and watching movies
- I am also an avid home chef that loves to try new recipes! 
- My goals for 2024: landing my dream job in data!
